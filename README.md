# Elvis Operator

This project provides the implementation of an Elvis operator and the code samples from a [**CodeFX** blog about it](http://blog.codefx.org/java/roll-your-own-pirate-elvis-operator/).

It is fairly simple with a class [`Elvis`](https://github.com/CodeFX-org/demo-elvis-operator/blob/master/src/org/codefx/lab/elvis/Elvis.java?ts=4), which contains the operator, and a class [`ElvisDemo`](https://github.com/CodeFX-org/demo-elvis-operator/blob/master/src/org/codefx/lab/elvis/ElvisDemo.java?ts=4), which demonstrates its use as well as how you can solve the same problem without it.
